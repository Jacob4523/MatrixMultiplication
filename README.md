## Matrix Multiplication App

This app prompts you to input two .txt files with square matrices inside them or two integers, then the app will compute matrix multiplication on those two matrices. After the computation is complete, the program will write the new matrix into a file.

## Inputting Files

Enter in one file containing a matrix at a time (as prompted)

The app will compute the matrix multiplication with the matrices you provided then write the resulting matrix into a new file named 'matrix3.txt'.

## Inputting Integers

Enter in one integer at a time (as prompted)

This method will generate a square matrix per each integer inputted (one at a time as prompted). The values of the elements in the matrices are random from 1 to 100. Each square matrix that is generated will be written to new files named 'matrix1.txt' and 'matrix2.txt' respectively.

The integer inputted determines the size of the rows of each matrix, and therefore the size of each square matrix.

When inputting integers, both integers must have the same value in order for the app to make a square matrix.

The app will compute the matrix multiplication with the generated matrices then write the resulting matrix into a new file named 'matrix3.txt

## Sample Matrices

This app comes with two premade matrices, 'MatrixA.txt' and 'MatrixB.txt', as an example.
